            Trading involves substantial risk and is not for every investor.
            Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing onesâ€™
            financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used
            for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should
            consider trading.The Krypto Knight offers general trading advice
            that does not take into consideration your own trading experiences,
            personal objectives and goals, financial means, or risk tolerance.
            Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
